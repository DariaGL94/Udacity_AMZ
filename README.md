# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This dataset contains personal data about bank customers that are part of a bankmarketing compain. We seek to predict whether the campaign will be successful or not for a customer.
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best performing model was a
## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
The first step in the pipeline archtecture is the cleaning of the data. Therefore all categorical variables such as marital, housing, loan etc. are one hot encoded. NaNs are removed and dates set in the right format. Then the dataset is split into a training (70%) and test set (30%). We are using a logistic regression (binary classification of y) with hyperparameters C (inverse of regulation strength) and max_iter (maximum numbers of iterations to converge). Smaller values of C cause stronger regularization.
**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
The Random sampling supports discrete (max_iter) as well as continuous (C) hyperparameters. Random sampling can be used as an initial search with an later refinement for better results. It also supports early termination, so it is a low-budget solution in contrast to Grid sampling or Bayesian sampling.
**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**
The Bandit policy prevents that an algorithm is taking too many iterations to every posiible combination of hyperparameters without producing better results. It is based on factor/slack amount of the most successful job.
## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
